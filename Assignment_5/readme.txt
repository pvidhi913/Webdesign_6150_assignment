INFO 6150 WEB DESIGN AND USER EXPIRENCE ENGINEERING ASSIGNMENT 5

1. Variables
In SCSS, variables are used to store and reuse values, making it easier to maintain a consistent design throughout the project. They are denoted by the $ symbol and can be assigned values like colors, fonts, or other properties.

2. Custom Properties
Custom properties, often referred to as CSS variables, allow for dynamic value assignment in CSS. They are defined using --variable-name and provide flexibility in theming and style adjustment.

3. Nesting
SCSS supports nesting, which helps maintain a structured and organized codebase by representing the hierarchy of HTML elements within your styles. This nesting can be done for selectors, properties, and even pseudo-selectors.

4. Interpolation
Interpolation, denoted by #{$variable}, allows you to dynamically insert the value of a variable into a property or selector, enabling the creation of dynamic and reusable styles.

5. Placeholder Selectors
Placeholder selectors, represented by %selector-name, serve as templates for styles and are only compiled into CSS when explicitly extended. They're useful for creating reusable base styles.

6. Mixins
Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS that can be included in other selectors. They enable you to avoid repeating the same code and help maintain a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase. Mixins can accept arguments and parameters.

7. Functions
SCSS supports custom functions, allowing for complex calculations and value transformations within your styles. Functions can be used to calculate values, generate gradients, and much more.


8. Extends
The @extend directive lets you inherit styles from one selector to another, making it easier to create variant styles while maintaining code reusability.

9. Import 
@import  function is used to bring in the modular files.

10. Map features
The map feature is used to create collections of key-value pairs. It allows you to store data in a structured format, which can be particularly useful for managing complex sets of related values.

11. SCSS Grid Layouts

Grid determines where the block of text and other design components sit on the page.It is a structure of columns and lines that helps to design a website.

12.Flexbox Layouts
Flex layout makes it easier to design and build responsive web pages without using many float and position properties in the CSS code.
